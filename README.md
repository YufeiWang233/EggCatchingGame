# EggCatchingGame
This game is written in unobstrusive JavaScript and CSS, rendered in HTML Canvas. It includes a "score" that is updated as the user plays, and also a "life" metric useful for ranking the player.

Its difficulty will become harder as the user progresses in the game, as the number of eggs will increase by time.

The score and metrics are stored in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the best score and metric values are available for the user to see.

This game is hosted on surge:
